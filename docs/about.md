## Ghilaine ##

I connect ideas and people to solve complex or difficult problems. I am operational, taking someone’s vision to reality. I am enthusiastic about technology and how it can improve society. I am curious.

I build and maintain relationships across multiple disciplines, cultures and levels, translating business needs to the technical teams and providing practical feedback to the leadership or executive teams.

I develop permanent or temporary global teams and have a passion for diverse views and cultural differences. I create order from chaos and build scalable and robust processes and programs to take a business from start up through scale up and beyond.

Enabler: I relish new opportunities with the chance to make an impact and help others succeed.

Influencer and Collaborator: Using empathy, understanding and robust rationale, I like to discuss my way to the right solution, bringing people along with me: Collaboration brings innovation!

Trust and Empowerment: Having confidence in and high expectations of others has produced great results. I don’t underestimate the chance of an unexpected solution to an issue from people's creativity and wanting to be the best they can be.

Specialties: Relationships, Diversity and Inclusion; Operation Management, Process, Procedure, Program Management, Change Management, Start up, Scale up

I am an expert in enterprise software integration and development. I deliver high quality, scalable, software that behaves predictably and fails gracefully.

I understand the needs of the business and articulate them to the technical teams, building R&D teams to scale for growing business with agility in mind as the teams become based around a product not a person.

I execute decisions after systematic planning and collaboration with the end user. I ensure that projects are designed with clear user requirements and can be tested throughout the development lifecycle. Backwards compatibility and stability are my primary considerations.
