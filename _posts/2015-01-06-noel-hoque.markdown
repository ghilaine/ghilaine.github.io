_When tackling a problem, Ghilaine is second to none, her ideas and insight are not only exceedingly useful, but she can see an idea from an all-round perspective through her valuable knowledge, not only in terms of business but fashion too. One can get too focussed when concentrating on a piece of work hours upon end, Ghilaine not only spotted potential flaws immediately, but provided useful and well thought out resolutions. What impressed me further are her methods of explanation and well defined approach. Ghilaine talked through her train of thought and involved me completely. Her warm and approachable nature is a pleasure to work with and I came out of our meeting more confident with my business case, aware of potential pitfalls and extra information that should serve me well as I embark on my business startup._
