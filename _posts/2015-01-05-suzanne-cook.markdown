_Ghilaine and I met each other when working at Microsoft. Always positive, technologically empowering and generous with her time, she is clearly committed to helping others understand aspects of growth and upscale to increase marketability and sustainability, whatever your chosen field of work. Helping me to understand that my personal approach and style, albeit rather unconventional, has a genuine value to clients free from the world of clich√©s and mumbo jumbo that often accompanies the business world, was truly refreshing. She is enthusiastic, informal and knowledgeable with a genuine interest in assisting others to manage their businesses as they grow without the frequently accompanying agendas._
