_Ghilaine, is one of the most amazing mentors I have had in the last one year, in this highly over crowded space of London StartUps. She knows and understand the early stage startups very well and knows how to give practical advice which will enhance your business immediately._

_She has a very hands on attitude and will spend time understanding your business, you as a founder & than come up with solutions._

_I can't recommend her enough. At personal level she is a wonderful person who can really lift you up and a coffee with her will inspire you immensely._
